# newlifebayarea

The New Life Bay Area web site.

## Getting Started
To run this project, first install node.js (http://nodejs.org/).
Then install Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

### Overview
Grunt automates the entire process of creating the New Life Bay Area web site through
'tasks,' which are defined in Gruntfile.js. The default set of tasks will generate a
new set of web pages and all the resources it needs.

This project uses the Assemble templating library to ease maintenance and any future
development, particularly of the header, footer, or navigation of the web site.

### Example Commands
